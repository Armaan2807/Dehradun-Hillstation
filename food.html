              I always visit this place when ever I come to Dehradun.the quality of food is very nice and hygiene is also taken care off well(they clean table before anybody sits) and not to forget there staff is very well trained and welcoming specially Nagi and Bhagat are my favourite there they exactly know what I want and they both always have a smiling face when ever they attend any guest.</p>

              It is an amazing bakery. Tried it for the first time. The breads are fresh and smell good. The cakes are baked perfectly. It is a good experience to buy in house bakery as well as high end nuts and chocolates too. I would say this bakery is the beat so far. </p>

              We visit Dehradun a lot, and this is our go to place to eat. Have been eating out since several years now. Good part is that they have not compromised on the quality at all.Amazing food. Cleanliness and hygine maintained. This is a must visit place for authentic Chinese cuisine and a beautiful view from the hill. It was worth it. Thank you for your excellent service.</p>
